# Airbridge Pretty Json

This extension converts track event logs from the Airbridge Android SDK v4 into a prettified JSON format.

- It does not support multiple logs at once. If multiple logs are present, the very first log encountered will be processed.  
- Paginated logs are ignored unless all pages are present.

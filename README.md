# Airbridge Pretty Json

This extension converts track event logs from the Airbridge Android SDK v4 into a prettified JSON format.  
It does not support multiple logs at once. If multiple logs are present, the very first log encountered will be processed.
Paginated logs are ignored unless all pages are present.
